This work was partly funded by ERC grant ShapeForge (StG-2012-307877). We thank Jiansong Deng and Ligang Liu for their insightful comments. The illustrations throughout the paper demonstrate that our tool enables a brush metaphor for painting patterns in the context of 3D printing, allowing novel interesting designs to be modeled and fabricated. The major challenge is to precisely control the topology of the patterns so that they print as a single connected component, or contain no holes when carved out.

This empowers non expert users with a simple brush metaphor, allowing them to easily paint complex structured decorations. We extend this idea to the space of design and fabrication. In particular, our technique ensures that synthesized patterns will be made of exactly one connected component, so that once printed they form a single object. To achieve this goal we propose a two steps synthesis process, first synthesizing the topology of the pattern and later synthesizing its exact geometry.

Using our technique, designers paint structured patterns that can be fabricated into solid, tangible objects, creating unusual and surprising designs of lamps, chairs and laces from examples. Such 2D curves are easy to print with a low-cost FDM printers as shown Figure 1, with the benefit that thin features are well captured by a single thread of plastic. The major factors in performance are the number of input pieces as well as the topological complexity of the input. An interesting extension of our approach is to produce two dimensional patterns with constrained topology. The challeng...</td>

Dynamic programming is computationally heavy, even though it could be parallelized to some degree.
