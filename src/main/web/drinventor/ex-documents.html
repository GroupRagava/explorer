Although our work provides a strong foundation, we identified several challenging future research directions in the area of 3D printability. Such technology is increasingly important as 3D printers become available for consumers. We believe that our system aids both novices and experts in resolving issues prior to costly printing (both in time and money). To our knowledge, our work is the first to combine both physically based analysis with automatic geometric corrections in a single unified system for improving printability. We have detailed an automatic system for both detecting and correcting 3D printability issues in static...</td>

However, although the quality of 3D printing has improved, both the time to print and the material costs have remained high. Moreover, there is no guarantee that a printed model is structurally sound.</td>

We present a system that addresses this issue by providing automatic detection and correction of the problematic cases. The structural problems are detected by combining a lightweight structural analysis solver with 3D medial axis approximations. After areas with high structural stress are found, the model is corrected by combining three approaches: hollowing, thickening, and strut insertion. Both detection and correction steps are repeated until the problems have been eliminated. This is usually achieved by making the input mesh a watertight manifold surface. Another common requirement is that the input mesh has no par...</td>

Unfortunately, to accurately represent the detail that can be produced by the modern 3D printers, a very fine resolution grid with millions of elements would need be used. However, if a better or different solution is developed, it can be readily added into our pipeline. Average printing time was 18 hours with three objects, and tray size was 300x200x150mm. After solidification they have plastic-like structure with tensile strength equal to 50MPa. Support material has a gel-like structure and helps to support the incomplete object during printing.

Our system for automatic detection and correction of structural issues in 3D printed objects has its limitations, but it could be extended in many directions. To provide fast solutions, we have used many simplifications. One area for future research is a more thor- ough evaluation of grip positions on the object that can vary for different objects and users, among other things. Another area of improvement is structural analysis. The structural analysis presented in this paper works accurately only when the used material is homogenous and rigid.

Previous computer graphics research on plants has focused on plant geometry creation and appearance (rendering), as well as efficient simulation. Simulation of complex plants is challenging, however, because plant meshes are typically designed for rendering, not simulation. Such authoring of simulationready plants augments and completes simulation, by making it easy to apply simulation to general, complex plant models. There are many strategies to create and edit plant geometry [Prusinkiewicz 1986; Pirk et al. 2012; Longay et al. 2012]. User-assist...</td>

Such fracture is computationally extremely inexpensive as the L 2 norm test can be performed in nanoseconds. Because each part has its own rendering mesh independent of all the other parts, the objects are automatically free of holes after separation and there is no need for any re-meshing. It can be seen that the performance is interactive even for very complex plants. Plants of small to moderate complexity are fast enough for real-time systems such as computer games.
